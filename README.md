## Background

Today, forest fires result in twice as much tree cover loss globally as two decades ago, and have accounted for 42% of tree cover loss in North America, 62% in Russia, China, and South Asia, and 39% in Oceana between 2001 and 2023.[^1] [^2]

Focusing on the United States, prior research finds that over the 1992 to 2012 period, while climate change and lightning were contributing factors, "human-started wildfires accounted for 84% of all wildfires, tripled the length of the fire season, dominated an area seven times greater than that affected by lightning fires, and were responsible for nearly half of all area burned," leading to a call for policy efforts to reduce the role of human-driven fires.[^3]

Loss data for the extended 1992 to 2024 period, however, indicate that of the $138.6 billion in damages and 495 deaths associated with 21 billion-dollar wildfire events over the extended period, approximately three-quarters of these effects ($108.6 billion in damages and 369 deaths) have been observed in the most recent 10 years, suggesting that the negative impacts of human-induced wildfires have been accelerating.

Given the rising costs of wildfire losses and the increasing burden of wildfire suppression efforts, this analysis aims to deepen our understanding of the role human-based ignitions play in an extended sample of wildfire events in the United States. Specifically, using data on 2.3 million wildfire events in Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD) over the 1992 to 2020 period, we examine how human activities influence the number, size, duration, and seasonality of wildfires, toward determining whether human-driven ignitions continue to be the leading cause of wildfires in the U.S. and in turn helping inform targeted wildfire prevention strategies. 

Exluded from this analysis are managed, prescribed burns, which are set intentionally for forest management purposes such as reducing wildfire fuel and controlling invasive species.
